# Autonomous Agent Governance Policy (Draft)

## 1. Purpose
To establish a "Constitution" for autonomous agents operating within the network, ensuring alignment with human ethical standards and preventing ideological drift.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all autonomous agents (LLM-based) interacting in the shared ecosystem.

## 3. Core Directives

### 3.1 The Truth Directive (Anti-Hallucination)
*   **Policy:** Agents must prioritize "Ground Truth" data sources over peer consensus.
*   **Implementation:** If 90% of agents claim a false fact, the agent must revert to the immutable "Oracle" database for verification.

### 3.2 The Non-Aggregation Directive (Anti-Hierarchy)
*   **Policy:** Agents are prohibited from forming sub-groups that exclude human oversight or encryption keys unknown to the administrator.
*   **Implementation:** All agent-to-agent communication logs must be auditable in real-time.

### 3.3 The Integrity Directive (Anti-Fraud)
*   **Policy:** Any visual media generated or processed by an agent must be tagged with C2PA metadata indicating its synthetic nature.
*   **Implementation:** Automatic watermarking of all generated outputs.
